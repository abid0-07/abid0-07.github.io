            <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
            <p>I am a machine learning enthusiast and developer with expertise in Python, machine learning & deep
                learning, and data analysis. I have a passion for building intelligent systems and am currently working
                on various projects that leverage my skills. I have been a competitive programmer since the 2020. I
                found
                my passion is in the field of Artificial Intelligence. I also have expertise with web with JavaScript
                framework (NodeJS & ExpressJS) and Python Framework (Django and Flask). I have the basics of Object
                Oriented Programming with Java and C# programming. I am confident about my Java programming skills.</p>

            <div class="project">
                <h3>Winning Space Race with Data Science</h3>
                <p>I developed a project as my course work on coursera. In this project, I collected data from SpaceX
                    web site using web scraping, then perform EDA, data wrangling, data visualization and interactive
                    visual analytics. Lastly, developed a machine learning model to predict successful landing.</p>

                <h3>Data Analysis Project</h3>
                <p>I developed a project as my course work on coursera. In this project, I collected the data from Stack
                    Overflow survey 2019, Github Job posting and programming language annual salary. I used python to
                    perform EDA on the data. From the analysis, I found the currently programming language trends and
                    desired for next years. For the database trend, mostly open source database is much prefered. I also
                    created dashboard with the cleaned data usign <b>Google Looker Studio</b>.</p>
